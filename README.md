# employee-management-system

## Description

![badgeImg](https://shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

This command-line application enables a user to quickly and easily store and display information about their organization's roster. They will be able to create and manage departments, roles, and specific employees within the system. All roles will reference their department, and all employees will reference both their role and their manager.

I thoroughly enjoyed this project. The combination of past and present skills from class as well as the potantial real-world application of something like this made it pretty fun to code and nothing was abundantly challenging (maybe the triple join to view employees).
